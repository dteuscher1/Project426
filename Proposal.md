- 1.  *What research question are you trying to answer*

Do hustle plays in basketball influence winning? If so, which hustle plays are most important?

- 2.  *What data are you planning on using and where are you going to get the data?*

We are planning on pulling data from the NBA api (https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/).

- 3.  *How much data wrangling or cleaning will be required.  Are you planning on making new features?*

We will likely be add some new features. Most of the data will be clean, but we will be manipulating the data so that we get aggregate data for each team for each game.

- 4.  *What types of EDA are you planning on doing?*

We will be using lots of graphs and correlation.

- 5.  *What kind of machine learning model will you most likely use?*

We will likely look into Gradient Boosted Machine, but we will try a variety of methods to compare results. 

- 6.  *What are your anticipated results?  Do you have a hypothesis?*

Often time sports writers and reporters emphasize the importance of putting a little more energy into plays on the floor. We expect that hustle plays will have an impact on winning.

- 7.  *Outline a plan of how everyone in the group is going to participate in this project.*

David - Host of Git Hub
Matt - Assistant Host
McKay - Cheerleader

We expect that all will have a hand in creating EDA graphics and trying different models

- 8.  *Who's GitHub account are you planning on using to host this project? *
