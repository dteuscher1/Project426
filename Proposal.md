- 1.  *What research question are you trying to answer*

Do hustle plays in basketball influence winning? If so, which hustle plays are most important? Hustle plays are things such as contested shots, screen assists, loose balls recovered, box outs, and other plays that are not commonly recorded or recognized.

- 2.  *What data are you planning on using and where are you going to get the data?*

We are planning on pulling data through the use of this NBA API (https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) which provides a data frame of hustle stats for each game.

- 3.  *How much data wrangling or cleaning will be required.  Are you planning on making new features?*

We will likely be adding some new features. Most of the data will not be in the exact format we want it, but we will be manipulating the data so that we get aggregate data for each team for each game. We will compare both the difference and ratio of hustle plays between teams. We may need to join tables, but all of the necessary data will be pulled from the API.

- 4.  *What types of EDA are you planning on doing?*

We will be using graphs and correlation plots to explore the data and find potential relationships, distributions, interactions, etc.

- 5.  *What kind of machine learning model will you most likely use?*

We will likely look into a Gradient Boosted Machine, but we will try a variety of classification models to compare results. 

- 6.  *What are your anticipated results?  Do you have a hypothesis?*

Often time, sports writers and reporters emphasize the importance of putting a little more energy into plays on the floor. We expect that hustle plays will have an impact on winning.

- 7.  *Outline a plan of how everyone in the group is going to participate in this project.*

We are all contributing in getting the data, cleaning it, and performing EDA. Then each of us will fit a different model to the data so that we can compare model results.

- 8.  *Who's GitHub account are you planning on using to host this project? *
