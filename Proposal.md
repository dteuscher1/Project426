- 1.  *What research question are you trying to answer*

Do hustle plays in basketball influence winning? If so, which hustle plays are most important?

- 2.  *What data are you planning on using and where are you going to get the data?*

We are planning on pulling data through the use of this NBA API (https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/).

- 3.  *How much data wrangling or cleaning will be required.  Are you planning on making new features?*

We will likely be add some new features. Most of the data will not be in the exact format we want it, but we will be manipulating the data so that we get aggregate data for each team for each game.

- 4.  *What types of EDA are you planning on doing?*

We will be using lots of graphs and correlation to explore the ata and find potential relationships, distributions, interactions, etc.

- 5.  *What kind of machine learning model will you most likely use?*

We will likely look into Gradient Boosted Machine, but we will try a variety of methods to compare results. 

- 6.  *What are your anticipated results?  Do you have a hypothesis?*

Often time, sports writers and reporters emphasize the importance of putting a little more energy into plays on the floor. We expect that hustle plays will have an impact on winning.

- 7.  *Outline a plan of how everyone in the group is going to participate in this project.*

As of now, we don't have any cleary defined roles. Overall, we each plan to help with every part of the project from web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, cross validation, model tuning, etc. We will try to let each person in the group work to their strengths as well.

David - Host of Git Hub

Matt - Assistant Host

McKay - Cheerleader

- 8.  *Who's GitHub account are you planning on using to host this project? *
