Ideas:

Basketball:

 - Using player attributes to predict free throw rate
 - Predict the probability of a team winning a game
 - Predict the probability of whether a shot goes in or not
 - Predict shooting percentage of players in the clutch
 - Predict probability of team winning for March Madness
 - Do hustle stats predict winning? 
 - Shot quality modeling (https://fansided.com/2015/09/28/introducing-kobe-a-measure-of-shot-quality/)

For NBA, we could get the data using (nba-api)[https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/].

Baseball (if we wanted):

- Clustering pitches
