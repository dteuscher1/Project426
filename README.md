# Importance of Hustle Stats in the NBA

## Introduction

NBA analysts frequently mention "hustle" as a key to winning the game. If a team "hustles" more, then they are more likely to win. In this project, we were interested in the impact that hustle stats actually have in a team winning or losing an NBA game and whether the numbers will back up the claims that analysts ofetn make.

## Data Collection & Cleaning

The data used for the project was collected using the [`nba-api`](https://pypi.org/project/nba-api/) python package which is an API Client for (https://www.nba.com). Team-specific hustle data was collected for the 2018-2019 and 2020-2021 seasons. The 2019-2020 season was left out due to it being the COVID-19 shortened season that was resumed in the bubble and is very much an anomaly in recent history. For this project, we designated hustle stats as the following:
- Deflections
- Contested shots (broken down by 2s and 3s)
- Charges
- Screen assists
- Loose balls recovered 
- Boxouts (Offensive and Defensive)

In terms of formatting the data, the ratio and difference were calculated for each of the designated hustle stats.
